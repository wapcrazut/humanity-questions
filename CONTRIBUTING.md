# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the "Humanity Questions" project! We appreciate your interest in contributing. Before you get started, please take a moment to read through the guidelines below.

## How to Contribute

### Structure 

The project has a dedicated directory for the questions themselves. Each question should be in its own file (preferably in a Markdown format) with a clear and concise title or label.

```bash
├── questions/ # Main directory
│   ├── science/ # Category
│       ├── index.md # Category index file
│       ├── question_1.md # Question
│       ├── question_2.md
│       ├── ...
│   ├── ...
```

### Submitting New Questions

1. Check the existing questions to ensure your question has not already been added.
2. If your question is unique and has not been covered, please create a new Markdown file in the `questions/` directory.
3. Use a clear and concise title for your question.
4. Provide a detailed and well-reasoned description of the question.
5. If applicable, include any relevant sources or references to support your question.

### Creating New Categories

1. If you believe a new category is necessary to better organize questions, please open an issue to propose the new category.
2. Engage in discussions with the community to gain consensus on the need for the new category.
3. Once approved, you can create the new category directory in the `questions/` directory.
4. Add an `index.md` file with a brief description of the category's concerns. 

### Formatting Guidelines for Questions

- Format your questions using Markdown for consistency and readability.
- Use proper grammar and spelling to ensure clarity.
- If your question references external sources, provide citations using Markdown links.
- Keep questions concise and to the point.
